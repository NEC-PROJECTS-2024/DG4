### INTRODUCTION
In the realm of healthcare, predicting insurance costs has gained paramount importance, particularly post the Covid-19 pandemic. In this project we aim to predict the health insurance cost using regression models and try to predict the accurate results by  using this models. The dataset includes features like age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, children and charges which helps in developing a better and accurate prediction model. Before predicting the health insurance cost we have to follow some basic steps like Data Preprocessing, Cleaning and analysis of the data. After that we have to split the dataset into train and test data to train the models and validate them. By using different regression models we will train the model and get the best accurate result for the health insurance cost prediction.
